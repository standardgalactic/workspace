## Part II: Answer Key

1. Scalar irruption is a non-equilibrium instability characterized by abrupt, local amplification of a scalar field \( \phi \) when entropy curvature crosses a critical threshold. It is a phase transition in which entropic curvature coupling overwhelms diffusive smoothing, producing localized structure.
2. Standard models rely on gravitational instability within an expanding metric, where density evolution is dominated by dilution and background expansion. This framework assumes a static, non-expanding plenum in which structure emerges through internal redistribution of density driven by entropic smoothing, transport, and instability thresholds.
3. The entropic differential threshold is reached when the entropy-curvature coupling exceeds the smoothing scale, expressed as \( \beta \phi_0(1+\log\phi_0) > c^2 \). At this point the effective diffusion becomes negative and the system transitions from smoothing to amplification.
4. An entropy vault is a region where entropy curvature \( \kappa_S = -\Delta_g S \) is positive. This corresponds to locally concave-downward entropy geometry and indicates compression that can seed instability.
5. A crack point is a locality where entropy curvature exceeds a critical threshold \( \kappa_c \), causing the effective diffusion coefficient to become negative. The Laplacian term changes from a smoothing operator to an amplifying one, initiating local growth and bifurcation.
6. A lamphron state is a regime where entropy curvature suppresses amplification and reinforces smoothing, maintaining stability. A lamphrodyne state is a regime where entropy curvature contributes to growth, corresponding to sign inversion of the effective operator and permitting scalar irruption.
7. The NFR records fossilized traces of prior irruption events via a weak residual operator, functioning as a retarded integral memory kernel. It preserves integrated scalar amplification history so that past structure formation can influence future cycles.
8. PTLR acts through lattice symmetry recurrence and Poincaré return conditions to produce localized entropy compression. These curvature spikes raise \( \kappa_S \) toward the crack threshold, catalyzing irruption when the criterion is satisfied.
9. The growth rate is determined by the balance between the diffusion term (modified by entropy coupling) and the eigenvalues of the Laplace–Beltrami operator. When the effective coefficient in front of \( \lambda_k \) changes sign, \( \gamma_k \) can become positive, producing exponential amplification of unstable modes.
10. On a lattice \( \Lambda \), the discrete Laplacian at site \( i \) is defined by summing differences between neighboring sites and the site value, \( (\Delta_\Lambda \phi)_i = \sum_{j \sim i}(\phi_j - \phi_i) \). This implements diffusion and curvature analogs in the Crystal Plenum.

## Part III: Essay Questions

**Instructions:** Use the provided source context to develop detailed responses to the following prompts.

1. **The Geometry of Instability:** Discuss how scalar irruption can be interpreted as a phase transition in entropic geometry. Contrast the PDE formulation of sign-reversal diffusion with the quantum interpretation of inverted harmonic oscillators.
2. **The Five-Engine Plenum Architecture:** Analyze the interplay between the five coupled operators \( \mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{I}, \mathcal{N} \). How do these distinct thermodynamic regimes work together to govern the evolution of the scalar field?
3. **Non-Expanding Cosmology and Structure:** Explain how quasi-periodic structures and BAO-like (Baryon Acoustic Oscillation) signatures can emerge in a plenum with a static metric. How does the principle of mass conservation support this internal reorganization?
4. **Derived Geometric Consistency:** Examine the AKSZ/BV (Batalin–Vilkovisky) formulation of scalar irruption. How does the requirement of diffeomorphism-invariance in the entropy functional ensure the master equation is satisfied?
5. **From Continuum to Crystal:** Evaluate the transition from a smooth Riemannian manifold to a discrete lattice realization. Does the “Crystal Plenum” model suggest that scalar irruption is an inherent property of discretized space or an artifact of continuous modeling?
