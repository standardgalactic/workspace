## Part II: Answer Key

1. Scalar irruption is a non-equilibrium instability in which a scalar field φ undergoes abrupt local amplification when entropy curvature exceeds a critical threshold. It represents a phase transition where entropic curvature coupling overwhelms diffusive smoothing, producing localized structure.

2. Standard cosmology models structure formation within an expanding metric where gravitational instability operates alongside dilution from expansion. The plenum model assumes a static manifold with constant volume, where structure arises through internal redistribution driven by entropy, transport, and instability thresholds.

3. The entropic differential threshold occurs when entropy-curvature coupling exceeds the smoothing scale:

   β φ₀ (1 + log φ₀) > c²

   At this point effective diffusion becomes negative and amplification replaces smoothing.

4. An entropy vault is a region where entropy curvature κ_S = −Δ_g S is positive. This indicates locally concave-down entropy geometry and compression capable of seeding instability.

5. A crack point is a location where entropy curvature exceeds a critical value κ_c, causing the effective diffusion coefficient to become negative. The operator transitions from smoothing to amplification, initiating local growth and bifurcation.

6. A lamphron state is a regime in which entropy curvature reinforces smoothing and maintains stability. A lamphrodyne state occurs when entropy curvature drives growth, corresponding to sign inversion of the effective operator and enabling scalar irruption.

7. The NFR records fossilized traces of prior irruption events through a weak residual memory kernel. It preserves the integrated history of scalar amplification so that past structure formation influences future evolution.

8. PTLR produces localized entropy compression through lattice recurrence and symmetry return conditions. These curvature spikes elevate κ_S toward the crack threshold, catalyzing irruption once the instability criterion is met.

9. The growth rate depends on the balance between diffusion modified by entropy coupling and the eigenvalues λ_k of the Laplace–Beltrami operator. When the effective coefficient multiplying λ_k changes sign, γ_k becomes positive and unstable modes grow exponentially.

10. On a lattice Λ, the discrete Laplacian is defined by summing neighbor differences:

(Δ_Λ φ)*i = ∑*{j ~ i} (φ_j − φ_i)

This operator approximates diffusion and curvature in the Crystal Plenum.

## Part III: Essay Questions

1. **The Geometry of Instability**
   Discuss scalar irruption as a phase transition in entropic geometry. Contrast sign-reversal diffusion in the PDE formulation with the quantum picture of inverted harmonic oscillator instabilities.

2. **The Five-Engine Plenum Architecture**
   Analyze the interaction of the operators 𝓖, 𝓡, 𝓟, 𝓘, and 𝓝. Explain how smoothing, memory, recurrence, amplification, and fossilization jointly govern scalar evolution.

3. **Non-Expanding Cosmology and Structure**
   Explain how quasi-periodic structures and BAO-like signatures can arise in a static metric. Discuss how global mass conservation supports internal reorganization rather than volumetric growth.

4. **Derived Geometric Consistency**
   Examine the AKSZ/BV formulation. Explain how diffeomorphism invariance of the entropy functional contributes to satisfaction of the classical master equation.

5. **From Continuum to Crystal**
   Evaluate the transition from a smooth manifold to a discrete lattice. Assess whether the Crystal Plenum suggests scalar irruption is intrinsic to discretized space or a feature of the continuous formulation.
