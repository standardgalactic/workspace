# Scalar Irruption via Entropic Differential  
## Non-Equilibrium Structure Formation in a Static Plenum

This repository presents a structured overview of the Scalar Irruption framework: a non-expansionary model of cosmological structure formation based on entropy curvature and sign inversion of effective diffusion within a static plenum.

Rather than relying on metric expansion or inflationary vacuum potentials, this framework proposes that structure emerges from internal entropic geometry through threshold-driven instability.

## Core Idea

At the heart of this framework lies a single mathematical transition:

`D_eff = c² − β φ₀ κ_S`

When `D_eff > 0`, the system smooths.  
When `D_eff < 0`, the system amplifies.  

Structure begins when smoothing flips sign.

## The Five-Engine Plenum Architecture

The plenum evolves under five coupled operators:

- **GAS** — Gradient Anisotropic Smoothing  
- **DTR** — Deferred Thermodynamic Reservoirs  
- **PTLR** — Poincaré-Triggered Lattice Recrystallization  
- **SIED** — Scalar Irruption via Entropic Differential  
- **NFR** — Neutrino Fossil Registry  

Together, these define a conserved, non-expanding cosmological architecture where complexity is internally reorganizational rather than expansion-driven.
