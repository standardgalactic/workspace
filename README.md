## Non-Equilibrium Structure Formation in a Static Plenum

This repository outlines an exploratory framework for cosmological structure formation that does not rely on metric expansion. The Scalar Irruption model investigates how entropy curvature and sign inversions in effective diffusion could generate structure within a static plenum.

The material presented here is preliminary and should be read as a working hypothesis rather than a finished theory. It combines analytic sketches and numerical experiments intended to probe the mathematical behavior and stability properties of the proposed mechanism. A full relativistic formulation, microphysical grounding, and comparison with observational data remain open tasks.

At its core, the framework explores whether threshold-driven changes in entropic geometry can convert diffusive smoothing into localized amplification, producing instability-driven structure without geometric expansion.

## Core Idea

At the heart of this framework lies a single mathematical transition:

`D_eff = c² − β φ₀ κ_S`

When `D_eff > 0`, the system smooths.  
When `D_eff < 0`, the system amplifies.  

Structure begins when smoothing flips sign.

## The Five-Engine Plenum Architecture

The plenum evolves under five coupled operators:

- **GAS** — Gradient Anisotropic Smoothing  
- **DTR** — Deferred Thermodynamic Reservoirs  
- **PTLR** — Poincaré-Triggered Lattice Recrystallization  
- **SIED** — Scalar Irruption via Entropic Differential  
- **NFR** — Neutrino Fossil Registry  

Together, these define a conserved, non-expanding cosmological architecture where complexity is internally reorganizational rather than expansion-driven.
