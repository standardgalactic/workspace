00:00.000 --> 00:07.340
All right, let's unpack this. We are dicing into a topic that takes the core mechanics of how

00:07.340 --> 00:13.800
modern AI learns optimization and asks a deceptively simple yet fundamentally challenging

00:13.800 --> 00:19.880
question. What if the persistent failure modes of our most powerful algorithms aren't just

00:19.880 --> 00:25.540
engineering or hyperparameter tuning issues, but deeply rooted geometric problems?

00:25.540 --> 00:31.180
Precisely. We are talking about stochastic gradient descent with momentum SGDM. I mean,

00:31.240 --> 00:34.600
it is the workhorse of nearly all large-scale deep learning models.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.200
It's everywhere.

00:35.360 --> 00:39.660
It's everywhere. And it's incredibly effective at finding local minima. But it has these

00:39.660 --> 00:44.520
characteristic instabilities. It drifts into parameter regions that correspond to, well,

00:45.060 --> 00:46.440
meaningless noisy representation.

00:46.660 --> 00:47.740
We just waste cycles.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.040
It was precious computational time oscillating back and forth for no good reason.

00:51.040 --> 00:55.200
So in the classical view, SGDM treats the space where the model's parameters live.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.060
And this space can have billions of dimensions as basically flat and uniform.

00:59.740 --> 01:03.980
Yes. And that framework, it totally ignores the fact that meaningful representations,

01:04.260 --> 01:06.800
you know, like a coherent image or a grammatically valid sentence,

01:07.220 --> 01:14.340
they actually occupy a very specific, often curved and constrained subset of that massive space.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.600
That is the core conflict.

01:15.860 --> 01:21.320
It is. And the solution we are analyzing today is the Manifold Aligned Generative Inference,

01:21.320 --> 01:23.100
or NGI framework.

01:23.740 --> 01:27.000
Man-GI proposes this really radical idea.

01:27.180 --> 01:27.600
Which is?

01:27.720 --> 01:30.440
That learning should not unfold in arbitrary Euclidean space,

01:30.600 --> 01:36.680
but along a specific geometric object called a Whitney-stratified remaining in semantic manifold.

01:36.900 --> 01:37.560
That's a mouthful.

01:37.940 --> 01:41.240
It is. But the key is that this manifold captures the intrinsic,

01:41.560 --> 01:44.500
often singular geometry of meaningful representations.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.640
And here's the central mission of this deep dive.

01:46.780 --> 01:51.160
We are going beyond just, you know, comparing MGI and SGM as two competing ideas.

01:51.660 --> 01:55.620
We are unpacking the mathematical proof that SGDM is not just similar to Maggi-I.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.260
It's a part of it.

01:56.420 --> 02:00.960
Exactly. It arises naturally as a degenerate geometric limit of Maggi-I.

02:01.420 --> 02:06.540
We are going to show how when you systematically strip away all the geometric structure and constraints

02:06.540 --> 02:10.880
that make MGI robust, you are left inevitably with SGDM.

02:10.880 --> 02:15.920
Which really reveals SGDM as a minimal, geometry-blind boundary case

02:15.920 --> 02:19.200
of a much deeper theory of structured learning dynamics.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.380
So to really understand why a geometric approach is even necessary,

02:22.700 --> 02:26.560
we have to start by detailing the classical assumptions that SGDM relies on.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.600
And more importantly, why these assumptions are ultimately the source of its instability

02:30.600 --> 02:32.040
and, you know, inefficient learning.

02:32.360 --> 02:32.520
Right.

02:32.660 --> 02:38.360
What does it mean mathematically to treat parameter spaces as undifferentiated Euclidean domains?

02:38.360 --> 02:41.760
It sounds academic, but the consequence is profound.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.600
When we say that, we mean two things.

02:44.060 --> 02:48.360
First, mathematically, the lost landscape is assumed to live in a standard flat space.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.160
The shortest path between two points is a straight line,

02:51.320 --> 02:53.780
and the metric of distance is uniform everywhere.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.880
And the second thing, the semantic meaning.

02:56.220 --> 02:59.660
Semantically, it means the optimization algorithm is operating under the assumption

02:59.660 --> 03:02.620
that all directions in the ambient space are to the N.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.500
Which could be R to the 100 million for a big model.

03:05.720 --> 03:06.080
Easily.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.500
It assumes all those directions are potentially semantically valid.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.200
So if you take your current parameter vector and nudge it randomly,

03:14.060 --> 03:17.600
SGDM assumes that movement is just as valid as any other.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.860
Even if it results in total gibberish.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.540
Exactly.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.820
Regardless of whether it results in a small, coherent improvement

03:23.820 --> 03:25.940
or a massive leap into gibberish space,

03:26.600 --> 03:29.040
the underlying geometry of what makes sense,

03:29.340 --> 03:30.700
of meaningful representation,

03:31.220 --> 03:34.020
it plays absolutely no explicit role.

03:34.020 --> 03:37.620
That sounds like optimizing blindfolded inside a massive warehouse

03:37.620 --> 03:41.720
where only a tiny winding path on the floor actually leads to the exit.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.180
And you're just constantly bumping into walls,

03:44.280 --> 03:45.820
thinking those bumps are part of the journey.

03:46.020 --> 03:47.220
That's an excellent analogy.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.100
The parameters that correspond to coherent data,

03:50.240 --> 03:52.680
say a model generating highly structured data,

03:53.140 --> 03:54.500
they don't fill the entire space.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.720
They live on that low-dimensional, potentially curved path.

03:57.860 --> 03:59.860
And SGDM ignores the path.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.500
By ignoring this intrinsic structure,

04:01.640 --> 04:04.940
it generates several well-documented and problematic failure modes.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.680
Okay, let's focus on the first one.

04:07.360 --> 04:07.700
Drift.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.920
We've all seen models that, you know,

04:09.980 --> 04:12.920
they minimize the loss, but the output is just bizarre.

04:13.180 --> 04:14.680
That's the classic failure mode.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.740
Drift into regions with no coherent interpretation.

04:17.740 --> 04:20.820
The model finds a numerical minimum, sure,

04:21.420 --> 04:24.520
but that minimum happens to exist in a zone of parameter space

04:24.520 --> 04:26.180
that is geometrically disconnected

04:26.180 --> 04:30.240
from the true structured manifold of valid representations.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.080
Like in an image generator.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.700
For instance, in an image generator,

04:33.900 --> 04:35.680
the loss might decrease slightly,

04:35.900 --> 04:37.480
but the output image suddenly melts

04:37.480 --> 04:41.520
or turns into a texture that violates the structural rules of vision.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.640
The parameters are in a region that has no functional meaning

04:44.640 --> 04:47.900
relative to the geometry of the real-world data it was trained on.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.960
And the second major issue is that notorious oscillation,

04:51.340 --> 04:53.100
especially when the learning rate is too high

04:53.100 --> 04:54.360
or the landscape is steep.

04:54.620 --> 04:57.540
That oscillation is often caused by off-manifold drift.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.640
Because SGDM permits motion in any direction,

05:01.120 --> 05:01.940
the gradient vector,

05:02.100 --> 05:04.860
which is calculated to minimize the loss in R to the N,

05:05.300 --> 05:06.860
it frequently contains a large component

05:06.860 --> 05:09.000
that is perpendicular or, you know, orthogonal

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
to the underlying semantic manifold.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.360
And we call that the normal component.

05:13.360 --> 05:13.960
We do.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.280
Why is that normal component so dangerous

05:16.280 --> 05:18.560
when you add momentum into the mix?

05:18.720 --> 05:20.900
This is the crux of the geometric instability.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.340
I mean, the momentum term is designed to accumulate

05:24.340 --> 05:27.420
and reinforce consistent gradients, right?

05:27.440 --> 05:29.400
To build inertia to push you over small hills.

05:29.580 --> 05:29.700
Right.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.920
But the SGDM velocity update, VK plus 1,

05:33.440 --> 05:35.760
is just a weighted sum of the previous velocity

05:35.760 --> 05:36.660
and the current gradient.

05:37.000 --> 05:37.240
Yeah.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.440
And because there is no constraint, no projection,

05:40.360 --> 05:42.400
SGDM permits the direct accumulation

05:42.400 --> 05:45.680
of these normal components through that momentum term.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.760
So if the previous step had a bit of off-manifold noise

05:48.760 --> 05:52.040
and the current gradient adds more off-manifold noise,

05:52.280 --> 05:55.100
the momentum ensures those two errors just compound.

05:55.300 --> 05:55.780
Precisely.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.720
It reinforces motion in directions

05:57.720 --> 05:59.780
that take the representation further away

05:59.780 --> 06:00.860
from semantic coherence,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.900
leading to that chronic oscillation.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.080
This accumulated off-manifold velocity

06:05.080 --> 06:07.400
is just geometrically meaningless noise

06:07.400 --> 06:09.440
that the algorithm mistakenly treats

06:09.440 --> 06:11.160
as useful inertial progress.

06:11.260 --> 06:13.620
Which leads naturally to the final issue you mentioned,

06:14.020 --> 06:14.480
fragility.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.580
If your dynamics are not respecting

06:16.580 --> 06:19.400
the intrinsic invariant geometry of the problem,

06:19.880 --> 06:21.600
then they will inherently be sensitive

06:21.600 --> 06:24.040
to local distortions of the coordinate systems.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.880
A small change in how you set up your problem

06:26.880 --> 06:28.620
or a slight numerical perturbation

06:28.620 --> 06:31.300
can send the dynamics wildly off track

06:31.300 --> 06:33.080
because they're not anchored to anything real.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.320
To the underlying structure.

06:34.320 --> 06:37.580
S-GDM is fundamentally lacking the structural defense

06:37.580 --> 06:39.240
against this geometric noise.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.340
So Meggi introduces that structural defense.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.040
It stops being geometry-blind.

06:44.260 --> 06:44.500
Yes.

06:45.220 --> 06:47.040
Meggi's geometric premise is simple.

06:47.420 --> 06:48.600
If the problem has a structure,

06:48.860 --> 06:51.060
the solution must respect that structure.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.160
Learning has to unfold along M,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.020
a subset of R to the N,

06:55.380 --> 06:58.040
which is the stratified Romanian semantic manifold.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.200
And the defense mechanism is built into the dynamics.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.800
Right, through a constrained form of heavy ball dynamics.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.140
The key mechanism is the tangent projection.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.360
That projection is the mechanical guardrail, right?

07:08.780 --> 07:09.140
Exactly.

07:09.420 --> 07:11.900
It explicitly projects the ambient gradient

07:11.900 --> 07:14.020
onto the tangent spaces of the manifold.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.500
We denote it pi sub txm.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.620
And this operation fundamentally suppresses

07:19.620 --> 07:21.500
motion orthogonal to the manifold.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.260
It keeps the model focused only on semantically valid changes.

07:25.740 --> 07:29.340
It forces the optimization to walk only on that winding path

07:29.340 --> 07:31.880
on the warehouse floor and just ignore the walls.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.440
We've established the yy-flat optimization is unstable.

07:35.940 --> 07:38.680
Now let's slow down and build a vocabulary for the solution.

07:38.880 --> 07:42.060
I mean, MAGI relies on differential geometry,

07:42.320 --> 07:43.540
which might sound intimidating.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.280
It can be.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.340
But it gives us these extremely precise ways

07:46.340 --> 07:48.360
to define things like curvature and distance.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.440
So let's start with the basics.

07:49.980 --> 07:53.300
Smooth manifolds and the crucial concept of the Romanian metric.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.480
Smooth manifold is really the generalization of a surface.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.760
Imagine the surface of the Earth.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.800
Globally, it's curved. It's a sphere.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.220
But if you stand anywhere and look around locally,

08:03.320 --> 08:04.040
it appears flat.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.080
Like a tangent plane.

08:05.320 --> 08:05.720
Exactly.

08:06.380 --> 08:09.640
That local flatness is what makes it resemble Euclidean space,

08:09.740 --> 08:10.220
r to the d.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.300
But crucially, a manifold is defined not just by its shape,

08:13.400 --> 08:15.060
but by how we measure things on it.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.500
And that's where the Romanian metric comes in.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.320
The Romanian metric, we call it g,

08:19.780 --> 08:21.300
is the defining geometric feature.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.820
It is a smoothly varying inner product, g sub x,

08:25.240 --> 08:27.840
defined on each tangent space, t sub x s.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.700
Think of the tangent space as that flat piece of paper

08:30.700 --> 08:33.060
you place down at point x on the curved surface.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.200
The metric, g sub x,

08:35.360 --> 08:38.020
tells you how to measure distances and angles on that paper.

08:38.460 --> 08:41.140
So the metric dictates the rules of movement and measurement

08:41.140 --> 08:43.060
specific to that location on the manifold,

08:43.260 --> 08:45.240
which is totally unlike Euclidean space,

08:45.300 --> 08:46.920
where g is the same everywhere.

08:46.920 --> 08:47.680
Precisely.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.500
This varying metric is what defines all the canonical geometric notions.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.060
Lengths of curves, angles between vectors,

08:54.320 --> 08:56.520
and most importantly, the geodesics.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.040
Geodesics, the generalization of a straight line.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.060
The shortest path between two points,

09:01.480 --> 09:03.080
but constrained to the curved surface.

09:03.620 --> 09:04.300
Without the metric,

09:04.600 --> 09:07.660
you have no way of defining straightness on a curved space.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.680
And this distinction movement along the surface

09:09.680 --> 09:11.040
versus movement off the surface

09:11.040 --> 09:14.540
is really the core of this coherence versus incoherence split.

09:14.540 --> 09:17.300
Let's elaborate on the tangent and normal spaces.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.500
This is the critical insight that NGI exploits.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.840
For any embedded sub-manifold s

09:22.840 --> 09:25.480
within our high-dimensional ambient space r to the n,

09:25.960 --> 09:27.040
at any point x,

09:27.180 --> 09:29.480
we have the tangent space t sub xs.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.380
The set of all valid moves.

09:31.660 --> 09:34.740
They are the instantaneous velocities of curves that stay within s.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.280
They are, by definition,

09:36.580 --> 09:38.280
the semantically coherent directions.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.060
Moving along the tangent space means the representation changes,

09:42.300 --> 09:43.900
but it remains structurally valid.

09:43.900 --> 09:47.340
Okay, so t sub xs is the set of all good moves.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.020
What about n sub xs?

09:49.280 --> 09:51.100
The normal space, n sub xs,

09:51.200 --> 09:54.200
is the orthogonal complement of the tangent space in r to the n.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.840
So t sub xs and n sub xs

09:56.840 --> 09:58.960
completely decompose the entire space.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.520
Any vector, like an ambient gradient,

10:01.900 --> 10:04.360
is uniquely split into a coherent tangential part

10:04.360 --> 10:05.980
and an incoherent normal part.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.900
And the normal directions are the incoherent perturbations.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.120
They're the vectors that take you

10:10.120 --> 10:11.940
immediately off the path of meaning.

10:11.940 --> 10:15.660
And MDI's foundational move is to use that orthogonal projection,

10:15.900 --> 10:16.760
pi sub t xs,

10:16.880 --> 10:19.040
to surgically discard the incoherent part.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.820
That is the mechanical heart of the framework.

10:21.020 --> 10:21.960
It's the geometric filter.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.820
Okay, moving on to the actual step.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.100
We have the Ramanian exponential map.

10:26.580 --> 10:29.860
So if SGDM uses simple vector addition,

10:30.280 --> 10:33.180
the exponential map is the geometric equivalent, right?

10:33.360 --> 10:33.720
That's right.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.640
The exponential map, sub x,

10:35.860 --> 10:38.740
it takes a tangent vector v from the tangent space

10:38.740 --> 10:40.500
and maps it back onto the manifold.

10:41.180 --> 10:42.820
It identifies the point you reach

10:42.820 --> 10:44.780
after traveling for one unit of time

10:44.780 --> 10:47.360
along the unique geodesic starting at x

10:47.360 --> 10:48.980
with that initial velocity v.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.460
Can you give us an analogy here?

10:50.720 --> 10:52.280
What's the real difference between

10:52.280 --> 10:54.180
moving with Euclidean translation

10:54.180 --> 10:56.540
and moving via the exponential map?

10:56.540 --> 10:59.040
Okay, imagine you are standing in Los Angeles.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.420
That's point x on a sphere,

11:00.660 --> 11:02.460
the manifold S, as SGDM would say.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.820
Take this vector v pointing northeast

11:04.820 --> 11:05.800
on the tangent plane

11:05.800 --> 11:07.860
and simply translate your coordinates

11:07.860 --> 11:09.640
in R3 by v.

11:09.780 --> 11:11.480
Which would put you somewhere in space.

11:11.620 --> 11:12.100
Exactly.

11:12.540 --> 11:13.720
That translation will land you

11:13.720 --> 11:14.760
slightly outside the earth.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.000
Your new parameter setting

11:16.000 --> 11:17.940
is now geometrically inconsistent.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.360
You've left the sphere.

11:19.480 --> 11:19.680
Right.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.940
The exponential map says,

11:21.560 --> 11:23.280
take that same northeast vector v,

11:23.660 --> 11:25.680
but now travel along the path of great circle,

11:26.220 --> 11:27.700
the geodesic for that distance.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.440
You remain perfectly on the surface of the sphere

11:30.440 --> 11:32.400
and you end up in, say, New York.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.600
So the exponential map

11:33.600 --> 11:35.160
is the geometrically precise way

11:35.160 --> 11:37.300
to move the representation along the manifold.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.300
It ensures structural integrity.

11:39.820 --> 11:40.260
It does.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.700
And this concept immediately eliminates

11:42.700 --> 11:44.860
why SGDM is a degenerate limit.

11:45.320 --> 11:46.620
We call it the Euclidean reduction.

11:46.820 --> 11:47.280
How so?

11:47.280 --> 11:50.000
If the manifold S is simply R to the end

11:50.000 --> 11:51.480
with the standard flat metric,

11:51.860 --> 11:53.900
then the geodesic is a straight line

11:53.900 --> 11:55.020
in the ambient space.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.880
In this minimal case,

11:56.960 --> 11:59.740
the exponential map simplifies exactly to translation.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.020
Sub X of V equals X plus V.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.320
And the dojection is absolutely critical

12:05.320 --> 12:07.920
for the SGDM equivalence proof we'll get to later.

12:08.220 --> 12:09.540
It shows that SGDM is just using

12:09.540 --> 12:12.520
the simplest possible geometry-free version of motion.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.040
And I appreciate that focus on geometric precision.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.220
I think it's important for you listening to realize

12:17.220 --> 12:19.840
that MAGI isn't just an approximation of geometry.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.120
It's defined using the exact tools

12:22.120 --> 12:24.740
of differential geometry for theoretical rigor.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.420
Even if computationally,

12:26.840 --> 12:27.940
people use retractions,

12:28.240 --> 12:31.140
which are approximations of the exponential map in practice.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.760
The theory is exact.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.180
We've covered smooth, curved surfaces.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.640
But real-world data manifolds,

12:37.780 --> 12:39.860
especially for these complex AI models,

12:40.080 --> 12:41.720
they're not always smooth, are they?

12:41.840 --> 12:42.360
Not at all.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.320
They often have sharp edges, corners,

12:44.480 --> 12:46.240
or places where the dimensionality changes,

12:46.540 --> 12:48.440
what mathematicians call singularities.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.620
And a smooth manifold can't handle those.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.140
It can, not robustly.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.080
This brings us to the concept of Whitney stratification.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.920
This is where MAGI goes beyond standard

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
Romanian optimization

12:58.920 --> 13:01.920
and addresses the complexity of real generative models.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.520
So if a smooth manifold is the single continuous road?

13:05.960 --> 13:08.440
A stratified manifold is an entire city map.

13:08.940 --> 13:11.200
It has different types of roads, highways, side streets,

13:11.360 --> 13:13.160
and complex multi-level interchanges.

13:13.380 --> 13:15.900
How does stratification organize these different roads

13:15.900 --> 13:17.300
or structural regimes?

13:17.620 --> 13:21.280
The semantic manifold M is a closed subset of R to the N

13:21.280 --> 13:23.800
that is decomposed into a collection of pairwise,

13:23.980 --> 13:25.820
disjoint-connected smooth submanifolds.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.220
We call these strata.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.180
Each stratum is smooth internally,

13:29.180 --> 13:30.700
but they meet in complex ways.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.260
And there are rules for how they meet.

13:33.660 --> 13:34.420
A crucial rule.

13:35.220 --> 13:36.120
The frontier condition.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.220
If a higher dimensional stratum S-beta

13:39.220 --> 13:41.720
meets a lower dimensional stratum S-alpha,

13:42.180 --> 13:44.960
then S-alpha must lie in the closure of S-beta.

13:45.660 --> 13:47.060
What does that mean semantically?

13:47.280 --> 13:49.260
Why must the lower dimensional structure

13:49.260 --> 13:51.080
be in the closure of the higher one?

13:51.360 --> 13:53.100
It imposes a semantic hierarchy.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.040
Think of a computer vision model.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.580
S-beta might be the manifold of all valid images

13:58.580 --> 14:00.340
of a human standing.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.580
S-alpha might be the manifold of all valid images

14:03.580 --> 14:04.700
of a human silhouette.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.060
Okay, the silhouette is simpler, lower dimensional.

14:07.420 --> 14:09.120
Right, and the silhouette manifold exists

14:09.120 --> 14:10.840
at the boundary of the more complex

14:10.840 --> 14:12.040
standing human manifold.

14:12.660 --> 14:14.600
You can approach the silhouette structure

14:14.600 --> 14:16.780
by simplifying the standing human structure.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.200
This ensures that transitions between modes

14:19.200 --> 14:21.260
are topologically ordered and, you know,

14:21.320 --> 14:21.980
physically sensible.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.460
Okay, we have the structure,

14:23.620 --> 14:25.180
but we need rules for navigation,

14:25.400 --> 14:26.660
especially at those boundaries.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.840
That's the role of the Whitney conditions, right?

14:29.380 --> 14:31.600
Why are these so vital for geometric consistency

14:31.600 --> 14:33.000
and robust optimization?

14:33.500 --> 14:35.320
They ensure that the geometric machinery,

14:36.080 --> 14:37.620
specifically the tangent projection,

14:38.080 --> 14:39.760
doesn't break down when you hit a corner

14:39.760 --> 14:40.800
or a singularity.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.760
Without these conditions,

14:43.180 --> 14:44.800
the tangent space of the approaching

14:44.800 --> 14:45.980
high dimensional stratum

14:45.980 --> 14:48.480
could just twist or collapse unpredictably

14:48.480 --> 14:50.060
as it touches the lower stratum.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.380
So let's break down the two main conditions.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.900
Condition A deals with converging tangent spaces.

14:55.900 --> 14:59.680
Condition A ensures tangent spaces converge coherently.

15:00.460 --> 15:02.680
As the sequence of points in the higher stratum

15:02.680 --> 15:04.460
approaches a point on the lower stratum,

15:04.860 --> 15:06.380
the tangent spaces have to approach

15:06.380 --> 15:07.840
a well-defined limit space.

15:08.060 --> 15:09.780
And the lower stratum's tangent space

15:09.780 --> 15:11.080
has to be inside that limit.

15:11.160 --> 15:11.520
Exactly.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.060
If this didn't hold,

15:13.560 --> 15:15.060
the gradient projection operator

15:15.060 --> 15:17.220
would jump discontinuously right at the boundary.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.180
That discontinuity would make

15:19.180 --> 15:21.560
the optimization flow completely unpredictable.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.360
It would just stall.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.040
And condition B,

15:24.420 --> 15:25.820
that handles the second lines.

15:25.980 --> 15:27.060
Condition B is more subtle.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.900
It controls how the second line

15:28.900 --> 15:30.400
connecting two nearby points

15:30.400 --> 15:32.300
behaves relative to the tangent spaces.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.540
It ensures that the way the manifold curves

15:34.540 --> 15:35.940
and bends near the singularity

15:35.940 --> 15:37.580
is geometrically regulated.

15:37.920 --> 15:38.460
So together,

15:38.700 --> 15:40.960
they guarantee the tangent projection operator

15:40.960 --> 15:42.740
is continuous across these boundaries.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.820
Which means MGI's central constraint

15:44.820 --> 15:46.660
is mathematically well-defined,

15:47.100 --> 15:48.820
even near the complex intersections

15:48.820 --> 15:50.240
of representation space.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.780
I think we need to solidify

15:51.780 --> 15:53.480
the semantic interpretation here.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.700
What are we gaining in terms of AI interpretability

15:56.700 --> 15:58.920
by imposing all this geometric rigor?

15:59.440 --> 16:01.280
Interpretability is directly built in.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.700
Each stratum, S-alpha,

16:04.120 --> 16:06.840
represents a specific coherent representational mode.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.580
In a model learning symbolic logic,

16:09.980 --> 16:12.080
a fratum might represent all expressions

16:12.080 --> 16:14.680
satisfying a specific structural constraint.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.420
And a transition between strata

16:16.420 --> 16:19.280
is a shift between these high-level semantic templates.

16:19.540 --> 16:19.740
Yes.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.460
The stratification provides the necessary topology

16:22.460 --> 16:24.900
to ensure that when the model moves from, say,

16:25.240 --> 16:26.700
cat image to dog image,

16:27.160 --> 16:29.660
the transition doesn't happen via random static noise.

16:30.140 --> 16:32.720
It has to follow the geometrically constrained boundary,

16:33.180 --> 16:34.020
the singularity,

16:34.280 --> 16:35.960
that separates those two meaningful modes.

16:36.100 --> 16:36.880
That's fascinating.

16:37.020 --> 16:38.240
It elevates model behavior

16:38.240 --> 16:40.000
from just a simple numerical change

16:40.000 --> 16:42.260
to a topologically meaningful semantic decision.

16:42.380 --> 16:42.720
It does.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.580
So we have the space,

16:44.820 --> 16:46.300
the stratified manifold M.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.900
Now we need a cost function

16:47.900 --> 16:49.720
that actually respects this space.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.460
MGI replaces arbitrary loss functions

16:52.460 --> 16:54.460
with stratified Morse potentials.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.480
Why is this structural upgrade

16:56.480 --> 16:58.200
to the loss functions so important?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.460
I mean, if you're going to enforce

17:00.460 --> 17:02.520
rigorous geometric rules for movement,

17:02.740 --> 17:04.460
you need to ensure the destination,

17:05.360 --> 17:06.340
the critical points,

17:06.460 --> 17:08.040
also obey geometric rules.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.560
Classical loss functions

17:09.560 --> 17:11.380
often have pathological features.

17:11.520 --> 17:11.920
Like what?

17:12.520 --> 17:13.600
Infinite flat regions,

17:13.840 --> 17:15.380
non-isolated critical points,

17:15.840 --> 17:17.320
or degenerate critical points

17:17.320 --> 17:18.920
where the second derivative test fails.

17:19.620 --> 17:21.740
These pathologies are endemic to deep learning

17:21.740 --> 17:23.980
and lead to notoriously slow convergence

17:23.980 --> 17:25.760
and poor generalization.

17:26.020 --> 17:27.460
And we know from classical Morse theory

17:27.460 --> 17:29.220
that those functions are mathematically beautiful

17:29.220 --> 17:30.620
because they guarantee simple,

17:30.780 --> 17:32.120
well-behaved critical points.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.460
So MGI is just extending that idea

17:34.460 --> 17:35.540
to the stratified space.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.060
Exactly.

17:36.060 --> 17:38.780
The potential V must satisfy two key properties.

17:38.780 --> 17:40.840
First, it has to be stratum-wise Morse.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.880
So restricted to any individual stratum,

17:42.940 --> 17:44.600
the function must be classical Morse function.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.220
Meaning, if you're optimizing

17:46.220 --> 17:47.780
within one semantic mode,

17:48.220 --> 17:50.320
all the local minima and saddle points

17:50.320 --> 17:51.420
are non-degenerate.

17:51.540 --> 17:52.880
Which makes the local dynamics

17:52.880 --> 17:54.240
highly predictable and efficient.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.540
And the second property ties it all back

17:56.540 --> 17:58.480
to the geometry of the singularities.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.520
That is stratified coherence.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.000
The critical structure has to fit together

18:03.000 --> 18:04.900
coherently across all strata,

18:05.260 --> 18:06.440
respecting the Whitney conditions.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.760
The benefit here is huge.

18:09.580 --> 18:10.960
The critical points are guaranteed

18:10.960 --> 18:13.860
to encode meaningful semantic equilibria.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.040
You avoid the chaos of finding a numerical minimum

18:17.040 --> 18:20.160
that is only stable because of some numerical accident.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.680
It sounds like MGI is requiring

18:22.680 --> 18:24.260
the loss landscape itself

18:24.260 --> 18:27.680
to be a well-structured, topologically clean surface.

18:27.960 --> 18:28.560
That's the goal.

18:28.980 --> 18:31.380
It ensures that optimization is deterministic

18:31.380 --> 18:33.120
and leads to interpretable results.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.240
The critical points are structurally stable,

18:35.240 --> 18:37.260
and the flow lines between them are clean.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.820
Now let's look at the gradient

18:38.820 --> 18:40.180
generated by this potential.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.140
Since we are constrained to M,

18:42.520 --> 18:44.060
the gradient is not the standard

18:44.060 --> 18:45.220
ambient gradient, is it?

18:45.500 --> 18:45.820
No.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.100
The MGI gradient is defined

18:48.100 --> 18:49.680
as the projected ambient gradient.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.560
We take the ambient gradient

18:51.560 --> 18:52.980
of the smooth extension of V

18:52.980 --> 18:54.480
and immediately project it

18:54.480 --> 18:55.560
onto the tangent space.

18:56.060 --> 18:58.120
This ensures the descent direction

18:58.120 --> 18:59.340
is always tangential

18:59.340 --> 19:00.980
and maximally coherent.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.280
We discussed this earlier,

19:02.440 --> 19:03.700
but let's emphasize the importance

19:03.700 --> 19:05.260
of the discarded component,

19:05.480 --> 19:06.960
the normal component signal.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.080
The normal component signal is vital.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.260
It's the part of the ambient gradient

19:11.260 --> 19:12.640
that's normal to the stratum,

19:12.800 --> 19:14.740
and it measures the geometrical tension,

19:15.300 --> 19:18.240
the degree to which the arbitrary ambient potential

19:18.240 --> 19:19.780
is trying to pull the representation

19:19.780 --> 19:20.720
off the stratum.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.660
So if it's large, it's not just noise,

19:22.760 --> 19:24.000
it's a structural warning.

19:24.360 --> 19:24.740
Exactly.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.720
A small normal component means

19:26.720 --> 19:28.880
we are successfully minimizing the potential

19:28.880 --> 19:30.080
while staying coherent.

19:30.660 --> 19:32.400
A large normal component means

19:32.400 --> 19:33.620
the current semantic mode,

19:33.740 --> 19:34.480
the current stratum,

19:34.620 --> 19:36.940
is inadequate to satisfy the global minimum.

19:37.460 --> 19:39.620
It signals a necessary structural change.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.380
It's the mechanism that signals

19:41.380 --> 19:42.720
a necessary semantic shift.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.820
The algorithm has to either adjust

19:44.820 --> 19:47.060
or transition to a lower dimensional stratum

19:47.060 --> 19:48.100
that can better accommodate

19:48.100 --> 19:49.620
the required descent direction.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.740
Okay, now we synthesize these concepts

19:51.740 --> 19:53.520
into the actual movement rules,

19:53.620 --> 19:55.220
the discrete dynamics of MANGI.

19:55.220 --> 19:57.640
We are moving from the continuous

19:57.640 --> 19:59.020
Romanian heavy ball flow

19:59.020 --> 20:01.400
to the district update steps.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.180
Right, the goal is to discretize

20:03.180 --> 20:04.440
the geometrically constrained

20:04.440 --> 20:05.880
Romanian heavy ball equation.

20:06.740 --> 20:08.520
SGDM is a discretization

20:08.520 --> 20:11.080
of the unconstrained Euclidean version.

20:11.820 --> 20:13.520
MGI is a discretization

20:13.520 --> 20:14.920
of the constrained version,

20:15.440 --> 20:17.360
ensuring the dynamics respect the curvature

20:17.360 --> 20:19.500
defined by the Romanian metric.

20:19.660 --> 20:21.060
Let's look at the heart of the algorithm,

20:21.580 --> 20:23.020
the MGI update rule

20:23.020 --> 20:24.620
when we are safely within a stratum.

20:24.620 --> 20:25.760
So no transition.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.280
The velocity update comes first.

20:27.380 --> 20:27.480
Yeah.

20:27.820 --> 20:30.160
Vk plus 1 equals beta times Vk,

20:30.220 --> 20:31.960
plus the projection of the ambient gradient

20:31.960 --> 20:33.100
onto the tangent space.

20:33.220 --> 20:34.640
And there's the constraint right there.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.120
Immediately.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.180
We take the previous velocity,

20:37.720 --> 20:38.540
scaled by momentum,

20:38.740 --> 20:40.240
and we add the projected gradient.

20:40.780 --> 20:41.720
The crucial result

20:41.720 --> 20:43.260
is that the new velocity vector

20:43.260 --> 20:44.820
is guaranteed to remain strictly

20:44.820 --> 20:45.820
in the tangent bundle.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.560
We have surgically removed

20:47.560 --> 20:49.420
the incoherent off-manifold push

20:49.420 --> 20:50.820
before it can be integrated

20:50.820 --> 20:51.560
into the momentum.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.520
And that single projection step

20:53.520 --> 20:54.580
is the entire difference

20:54.580 --> 20:56.480
between a structurally stable algorithm

20:56.480 --> 20:57.400
and SGDM.

20:57.700 --> 20:58.980
Then comes the position update,

20:59.120 --> 21:00.320
which moves us along the curve.

21:00.480 --> 21:00.720
Right.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.540
Xk plus 1 equals the exponential map

21:03.540 --> 21:06.260
at Xk of minus 80k Vk plus 1.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.160
The use of the exponential map

21:08.160 --> 21:09.320
is non-negotiable here.

21:10.080 --> 21:11.700
It ensures that the updated point

21:11.700 --> 21:13.200
remains precisely on the manifold,

21:13.800 --> 21:15.420
moving along the geodesic path

21:15.420 --> 21:17.080
dictated by the local geometry.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.220
So it maintains geometric consistency

21:19.220 --> 21:20.080
at the new point.

21:20.220 --> 21:20.580
Yes.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.480
Now, quick challenge,

21:21.560 --> 21:22.560
which I'm sure you listening

21:22.560 --> 21:23.260
are likely asking.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.800
This sounds incredible,

21:25.060 --> 21:26.560
but if MGI requires

21:26.560 --> 21:27.960
finding the tangent projection

21:27.960 --> 21:29.960
and calculating an exact geodesic step

21:29.960 --> 21:31.140
at every single iteration,

21:31.840 --> 21:33.340
isn't the computational overhead

21:33.340 --> 21:34.640
for this far too expensive

21:34.640 --> 21:36.100
compared to SGDM's

21:36.100 --> 21:37.120
simple vector addition?

21:37.340 --> 21:38.720
That is the right question to ask.

21:38.780 --> 21:40.320
So where is the practical tradeoff?

21:40.680 --> 21:42.680
For MGI to be computationally viable

21:42.680 --> 21:43.460
in high dimensions,

21:43.860 --> 21:44.580
two things are key.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.960
First, the manifold M

21:46.960 --> 21:48.400
must be implicitly defined

21:48.400 --> 21:49.360
or assumed to be

21:49.360 --> 21:50.540
an algebraic variety

21:50.540 --> 21:52.360
which allows the projection operator

21:52.360 --> 21:53.560
to be calculated efficiently,

21:54.300 --> 21:55.840
often via matrix operations

21:55.840 --> 21:57.940
related to Jacobian transpose products

21:57.940 --> 22:00.280
or even via deep implicit models.

22:00.500 --> 22:00.520
Okay.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.940
Second, while the theoretical definition

22:02.940 --> 22:04.860
uses the exact exponential map,

22:05.400 --> 22:06.800
practical implementations rely

22:06.800 --> 22:08.620
on fast, high-order retractions.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.220
These are computationally

22:10.220 --> 22:11.380
cheaper approximations

22:11.380 --> 22:12.620
that still satisfy

22:12.620 --> 22:14.180
the essential geometric properties,

22:14.540 --> 22:15.520
like staying on the manifold.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.840
So the theoretical rigor relies

22:17.840 --> 22:19.200
on the exact geometry,

22:19.460 --> 22:21.420
but the practical application relies

22:21.420 --> 22:23.460
on efficient geometric approximations

22:23.460 --> 22:25.720
that SGDM completely bypasses

22:25.720 --> 22:26.800
because it just assumes

22:26.800 --> 22:28.300
the approximation error is zero.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.920
Which is only true in flat space.

22:30.160 --> 22:30.420
Right.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.120
Precisely.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.420
SGDM assumes the problem is cheap,

22:33.560 --> 22:34.440
which is only valid

22:34.440 --> 22:35.640
if the geometry is trivial.

22:35.880 --> 22:36.080
Yeah.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.200
MGI accepts the geometric cost

22:38.200 --> 22:39.720
but gains structural stability

22:39.720 --> 22:40.820
and interpretability.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.240
Let's move to the stratum

22:42.240 --> 22:43.160
transition mechanism.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.680
When does this discrete semantic shift

22:45.680 --> 22:46.560
actually happen?

22:47.060 --> 22:48.340
It happens when the model realizes

22:48.340 --> 22:49.680
the current structural template

22:49.680 --> 22:50.300
is inadequate.

22:51.340 --> 22:51.960
This is triggered

22:51.960 --> 22:53.600
if the normal component signal,

22:53.920 --> 22:55.400
the magnitude of the normal gradient,

22:55.940 --> 22:57.580
exceeds a predefined threshold.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.960
So that signals

22:58.960 --> 23:00.240
that the ambient potential

23:00.240 --> 23:01.400
is forcefully trying

23:01.400 --> 23:02.420
to pull the dynamics

23:02.420 --> 23:03.900
off the current stratum.

23:03.960 --> 23:04.920
The system has hit

23:04.920 --> 23:05.920
a geometrical wall.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.760
It must shift

23:07.760 --> 23:09.140
its representational template.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.320
So it does what?

23:10.700 --> 23:11.960
The algorithm then selects

23:11.960 --> 23:12.520
a new target,

23:13.160 --> 23:14.200
a lower dimensional stratum,

23:14.400 --> 23:14.800
S beta.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.620
Due to the frontier condition,

23:17.060 --> 23:17.680
this transition

23:17.680 --> 23:19.240
has to be geometrically coherent.

23:19.960 --> 23:20.960
S beta has to be

23:20.960 --> 23:21.600
the unique,

23:22.140 --> 23:22.920
locally minimal,

23:23.140 --> 23:24.140
admissible stratum

23:24.140 --> 23:24.820
that contains

23:24.820 --> 23:25.600
the current point.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.180
And the transition update itself,

23:27.300 --> 23:27.920
how does that differ

23:27.920 --> 23:29.480
from the normal position update?

23:29.820 --> 23:30.620
The key is that

23:30.620 --> 23:31.640
the projection is now

23:31.640 --> 23:32.840
onto the tangent space

23:32.840 --> 23:33.860
of the new stratum.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.060
The gradient is projected

23:35.060 --> 23:37.080
onto T sub xk of S beta

23:37.080 --> 23:39.360
before taking the geodesic step

23:39.360 --> 23:40.120
along S beta.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.060
The genius here

23:41.060 --> 23:42.080
is that this transition

23:42.080 --> 23:42.740
is guaranteed

23:42.740 --> 23:43.900
to reduce the potential.

23:44.140 --> 23:45.260
It's not a random jump.

23:45.640 --> 23:45.960
Absolutely.

23:46.220 --> 23:47.060
The descent property

23:47.060 --> 23:47.920
is guaranteed.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.460
By moving to the

23:49.460 --> 23:50.540
lower dimensional stratum,

23:50.940 --> 23:52.080
the optimization flow

23:52.080 --> 23:53.240
aligns with the direction

23:53.240 --> 23:54.280
of steepest descent

23:54.280 --> 23:55.140
that the geometry

23:55.140 --> 23:55.880
now permits,

23:56.400 --> 23:57.660
effectively bypassing

23:57.660 --> 23:58.980
the local structural constraint

23:58.980 --> 23:59.640
that was causing

23:59.640 --> 24:00.780
that large normal signal.

24:01.220 --> 24:02.680
This inherent stability

24:02.680 --> 24:04.220
is MGI's single greatest

24:04.220 --> 24:04.940
advantage over

24:04.940 --> 24:06.200
classical momentum methods.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.580
So let's delve deeper

24:07.580 --> 24:08.920
into the structural flaw

24:08.920 --> 24:09.800
of SGDM

24:09.800 --> 24:11.640
that MGI completely avoids.

24:12.040 --> 24:12.820
Let's revisit

24:12.820 --> 24:14.360
the failure of SGDM.

24:14.460 --> 24:16.040
Okay, the SGDM velocity update,

24:16.160 --> 24:16.820
it's an open loop

24:16.820 --> 24:17.380
for instability.

24:17.640 --> 24:18.660
If we decompose

24:18.660 --> 24:19.480
the ambient gradient

24:19.480 --> 24:20.460
into its tangent

24:20.460 --> 24:21.560
and normal components,

24:22.040 --> 24:23.200
SGDM takes both of them.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.020
It doesn't filter.

24:24.220 --> 24:24.600
It doesn't.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.320
Crucially,

24:25.820 --> 24:26.620
the normal component

24:26.620 --> 24:27.320
of the velocity

24:27.320 --> 24:28.160
at the next step

24:28.160 --> 24:29.400
is just beta times

24:29.400 --> 24:30.540
the previous normal velocity

24:30.540 --> 24:31.880
plus the current normal gradient.

24:32.040 --> 24:32.520
Which means...

24:32.520 --> 24:34.020
It means SGDM permits

24:34.020 --> 24:34.600
the direct,

24:34.840 --> 24:35.800
unchecked accumulation

24:35.800 --> 24:37.420
of off-manifold motion.

24:38.020 --> 24:39.280
If the previous step

24:39.280 --> 24:40.620
had a small numerical error

24:40.620 --> 24:41.380
off the manifold

24:41.380 --> 24:42.780
and the current gradient

24:42.780 --> 24:44.160
also has a nosy component

24:44.160 --> 24:45.060
normal to the manifold,

24:45.580 --> 24:46.580
the momentum factor

24:46.580 --> 24:47.540
ensures these errors

24:47.540 --> 24:48.540
are compounded,

24:48.620 --> 24:49.400
often geometrically.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.100
The algorithm structurally

24:51.100 --> 24:51.760
reinforces

24:51.760 --> 24:52.960
its own geometric error.

24:52.960 --> 24:53.920
This accumulation

24:53.920 --> 24:54.960
explains why SGDM

24:55.680 --> 24:56.720
often requires

24:56.720 --> 24:58.360
aggressive regularization

24:58.360 --> 24:59.640
or gradient clipping.

24:59.960 --> 25:00.020
Yeah.

25:00.080 --> 25:00.840
You are manually

25:00.840 --> 25:02.340
trying to counteract

25:02.340 --> 25:03.540
the geometric instability

25:03.540 --> 25:04.940
that the momentum mechanism

25:04.940 --> 25:05.980
itself introduces

25:05.980 --> 25:07.720
when geometry is ignored.

25:07.940 --> 25:08.320
Exactly.

25:08.820 --> 25:09.640
You are trying to

25:09.640 --> 25:10.500
put out a fire

25:10.500 --> 25:11.820
that your dynamic started.

25:12.120 --> 25:12.960
MGI, however,

25:13.080 --> 25:14.140
is fundamentally different

25:14.140 --> 25:14.960
due to the projection.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.160
And this is formalized

25:16.160 --> 25:16.980
in the normal component

25:16.980 --> 25:17.740
suppression theorem.

25:18.040 --> 25:18.700
Let's tackle

25:18.700 --> 25:19.580
that theorem head on.

25:19.980 --> 25:20.680
It proves that

25:20.680 --> 25:22.260
MAGI structurally ensures

25:22.260 --> 25:23.860
that no new normal component

25:23.860 --> 25:24.860
is ever introduced

25:24.860 --> 25:25.820
through the momentum term.

25:26.200 --> 25:26.880
How does it do that?

25:27.060 --> 25:27.620
By projection.

25:28.020 --> 25:28.520
In MAGI,

25:28.820 --> 25:29.680
the velocity update

25:29.680 --> 25:31.300
ensures VK plus 1

25:31.300 --> 25:32.280
is entirely tangent

25:32.280 --> 25:33.300
to M at XK.

25:33.500 --> 25:34.380
The normal component

25:34.380 --> 25:34.980
is suppressed

25:34.980 --> 25:35.800
before it can enter

25:35.800 --> 25:36.560
the inertia term.

25:36.780 --> 25:37.280
This means

25:37.280 --> 25:38.600
the normal component

25:38.600 --> 25:39.260
of the gradient

25:39.260 --> 25:40.180
that we detect

25:40.180 --> 25:41.080
at the next step

25:41.080 --> 25:42.560
at XK plus 1

25:42.560 --> 25:43.860
can only arise

25:43.860 --> 25:44.660
from the intrinsic

25:44.660 --> 25:45.820
geometric structure

25:45.820 --> 25:47.140
of the manifold itself,

25:47.500 --> 25:48.760
not from compounding

25:48.760 --> 25:49.760
extrinsic noise.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.480
So if XK plus 1

25:51.480 --> 25:52.980
is slightly off the manifold,

25:53.280 --> 25:53.880
it's only because

25:53.880 --> 25:54.720
the manifold itself

25:54.720 --> 25:55.600
is curving away

25:55.600 --> 25:56.300
from the direction

25:56.300 --> 25:56.920
of movement.

25:57.100 --> 25:57.620
Precisely.

25:58.060 --> 25:59.020
The theorem states

25:59.020 --> 25:59.760
that the size

25:59.760 --> 26:00.680
of the normal component

26:00.680 --> 26:01.180
of the gradient

26:01.180 --> 26:02.120
at the next step

26:02.120 --> 26:03.800
is bounded by a term

26:03.800 --> 26:05.060
related to the differential

26:05.060 --> 26:05.720
of the gradient.

26:05.840 --> 26:06.720
Okay, let's translate

26:06.720 --> 26:07.860
that dense statement

26:07.860 --> 26:09.020
into practical terms.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.020
The key takeaway

26:10.020 --> 26:11.160
is that the normal component

26:11.160 --> 26:12.340
is bounded by a measure

26:12.340 --> 26:13.400
related to the change

26:13.400 --> 26:13.920
in the gradient

26:13.920 --> 26:14.780
along the direction

26:14.780 --> 26:15.980
of the tangential movement.

26:16.440 --> 26:17.620
This is directly related

26:17.620 --> 26:18.940
to the intrinsic geometric

26:18.940 --> 26:20.320
variation of the potential

26:20.320 --> 26:21.880
and the manifold's curvature.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.440
So it's geometry

26:23.440 --> 26:24.600
generating geometry.

26:25.040 --> 26:25.400
Yes.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.020
The normal component

26:27.020 --> 26:28.080
can only increase

26:28.080 --> 26:28.860
due to the curvature

26:28.860 --> 26:29.560
of the path

26:29.560 --> 26:30.220
you just took

26:30.220 --> 26:32.060
or how the steepest

26:32.060 --> 26:32.880
descent direction

26:32.880 --> 26:34.260
changes intrinsically

26:34.260 --> 26:35.700
as you move coherently

26:35.700 --> 26:36.560
along the manifold.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.860
SGDM allows external,

26:39.060 --> 26:39.700
extrinsic noise

26:39.700 --> 26:40.880
to accumulate linearly.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.000
MAGI only permits

26:43.000 --> 26:44.240
geometrically intrinsic

26:44.240 --> 26:45.700
generation of a normal signal,

26:45.920 --> 26:46.680
which is orders

26:46.680 --> 26:47.840
of magnitude smaller

26:47.840 --> 26:49.240
and much more stable.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.040
This is the structural defense

26:51.040 --> 26:51.560
that provides

26:51.560 --> 26:52.580
a foundational solution

26:52.580 --> 26:53.360
to instability.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.060
SGDM's instability

26:55.060 --> 26:55.740
is inherent

26:55.740 --> 26:56.500
because it lacks

26:56.500 --> 26:57.480
the projection operator.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.160
MAGI's stability

26:59.160 --> 26:59.800
is inherent

26:59.800 --> 27:00.680
because it demands

27:00.680 --> 27:01.440
that operator.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.420
Couldn't have said it better.

27:02.580 --> 27:03.340
Okay, we've established

27:03.340 --> 27:04.240
the structural difference.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.920
Now for the formal proof,

27:06.020 --> 27:07.240
the payoff of this deep dive,

27:07.680 --> 27:09.420
the MAGI SGDM

27:09.420 --> 27:10.280
equivalence theorem.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.100
It positions SGDM

27:12.100 --> 27:13.860
exactly as a geometry-free

27:13.860 --> 27:15.080
boundary case of NGI.

27:15.280 --> 27:15.440
Right.

27:15.660 --> 27:16.340
To prove this,

27:16.440 --> 27:17.360
we have to systematically

27:17.360 --> 27:18.640
enforce six assumptions

27:18.640 --> 27:19.560
that collapse

27:19.560 --> 27:21.000
all the rich geometric structure

27:21.000 --> 27:21.500
we just spent

27:21.500 --> 27:22.400
all this time defining.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.480
We begin by removing

27:23.480 --> 27:24.740
the most complex layer,

27:24.740 --> 27:26.000
the constraints

27:26.000 --> 27:27.400
of the semantic space itself.

27:27.500 --> 27:27.660
Okay.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.380
Assumption one,

27:28.800 --> 27:29.780
we abolish the notion

27:29.780 --> 27:31.000
of a constrained manifold.

27:31.380 --> 27:32.420
The semantic manifold

27:32.420 --> 27:33.480
equals the entire

27:33.480 --> 27:34.420
ambient space.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.220
M equals R to the N.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.320
We remove all curvature,

27:38.500 --> 27:39.060
all boundaries,

27:39.180 --> 27:39.760
all structure.

27:40.420 --> 27:41.160
The learning space

27:41.160 --> 27:42.640
is now just a massive

27:42.640 --> 27:43.540
undifferentiated

27:43.540 --> 27:44.200
flat plane.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.360
Assumption two,

27:45.520 --> 27:46.660
we remove the possibility

27:46.660 --> 27:47.560
of singularities

27:47.560 --> 27:48.620
or structural changes.

27:48.620 --> 27:49.540
The stratification

27:49.540 --> 27:50.240
becomes trivial.

27:50.520 --> 27:51.260
A single stratum,

27:51.440 --> 27:51.860
S0,

27:52.060 --> 27:53.180
which is just R to the N.

27:53.180 --> 27:54.700
If there's only one stratum,

27:55.100 --> 27:55.860
the Whitney conditions

27:55.860 --> 27:57.200
and all the transition mechanisms,

27:57.660 --> 27:58.520
they become irrelevant.

27:59.100 --> 27:59.860
The model is trapped

27:59.860 --> 28:00.780
in one global

28:00.780 --> 28:01.860
unstructured mode.

28:02.260 --> 28:02.900
Assumption three,

28:03.080 --> 28:04.400
remove the core dichotomy

28:04.400 --> 28:05.040
of coherent

28:05.040 --> 28:06.900
versus incoherent motion.

28:07.060 --> 28:07.940
The tangent space

28:07.940 --> 28:08.880
becomes the entire

28:08.880 --> 28:09.800
ambient space.

28:09.960 --> 28:10.100
Yeah.

28:10.260 --> 28:10.880
T sub X,

28:10.960 --> 28:12.180
M equals R to the N.

28:12.640 --> 28:12.980
Consequently,

28:13.140 --> 28:13.820
the normal space

28:13.820 --> 28:15.240
collapses to the zero vector.

28:15.700 --> 28:16.520
Every single direction

28:16.520 --> 28:17.200
is now defined

28:17.200 --> 28:18.360
as being semantically valid.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.800
This is the central falsehood

28:19.800 --> 28:20.800
of Euclidean optimization.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.220
And assumption four

28:22.220 --> 28:23.600
removes the very mechanism

28:23.600 --> 28:24.720
that enforces stability

28:24.720 --> 28:25.360
in MGI.

28:25.780 --> 28:27.020
The tangent projection operator

28:27.020 --> 28:28.280
becomes the identity operator.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.320
Since the tangent space

28:30.320 --> 28:31.380
is now the whole space,

28:31.960 --> 28:32.880
projecting onto it

28:32.880 --> 28:34.000
means doing nothing at all.

28:34.760 --> 28:35.880
The entire normal component

28:35.880 --> 28:36.780
suppression mechanism

28:36.780 --> 28:37.400
is disabled,

28:37.860 --> 28:39.220
allowing off manifold drift

28:39.220 --> 28:40.340
to accumulate freely.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.340
Assumption five

28:41.340 --> 28:42.520
collapses the sophisticated

28:42.520 --> 28:43.660
geometric movement

28:43.660 --> 28:45.020
into simple translation.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.220
The exponential map

28:46.220 --> 28:47.560
becomes Euclidean translation.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.140
Sub X of V

28:50.140 --> 28:51.560
equals X plus V.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.320
Geodesic motion,

28:53.480 --> 28:54.460
which accounted for curvature,

28:54.880 --> 28:55.700
is simplified down

28:55.700 --> 28:56.580
to vector addition.

28:57.420 --> 28:58.240
Computationally cheap,

28:58.440 --> 28:59.760
but geometrically inaccurate.

29:00.100 --> 29:00.600
And finally,

29:00.720 --> 29:01.400
assumption six,

29:01.580 --> 29:02.340
remove the guarantee

29:02.340 --> 29:03.940
of a well-structured potential.

29:04.340 --> 29:05.960
The stratified Morse potential V

29:05.960 --> 29:07.160
is reduced to an arbitrary

29:07.160 --> 29:08.480
smooth function F.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.220
We lose all guarantees

29:10.220 --> 29:11.360
regarding non-degenerate

29:11.360 --> 29:12.020
critical points

29:12.020 --> 29:13.280
and predictable gradient flows.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.120
We are back to the standard,

29:15.300 --> 29:16.380
potentially pathological

29:16.380 --> 29:18.060
loss landscape of deep learning.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.520
The power of this theorem

29:19.520 --> 29:20.320
is in the conclusion.

29:20.660 --> 29:22.360
If we apply these six conditions

29:22.360 --> 29:23.800
to the MFVI update rule,

29:24.140 --> 29:25.800
we recover SGDM exactly.

29:26.120 --> 29:27.000
The velocity update

29:27.000 --> 29:29.120
simplifies to VK plus 1

29:29.120 --> 29:30.380
equals beta VK

29:30.380 --> 29:31.660
plus the gradient of F.

29:32.060 --> 29:32.960
The position update

29:32.960 --> 29:34.960
simplifies to XK plus 1

29:34.960 --> 29:38.160
equals XK minus A to K VK plus 1.

29:38.780 --> 29:40.400
This is the SGDM algorithm.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.780
So the equivalence proves

29:41.780 --> 29:43.960
that SGDM is the flat,

29:43.960 --> 29:45.700
unstratified, geometry-free

29:45.700 --> 29:47.000
limit of MAI-GI.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.760
It is the minimal algorithm

29:48.760 --> 29:49.740
that results when

29:49.740 --> 29:51.500
all intrinsic geometric structure

29:51.500 --> 29:52.640
is just assumed away

29:52.640 --> 29:53.320
or suppressed.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.080
This fundamentally changes

29:55.080 --> 29:56.700
how we view momentum methods.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.240
It's not that SGDM

29:58.240 --> 29:59.200
is fundamentally different,

29:59.380 --> 30:00.280
it's that it's fundamentally

30:00.280 --> 30:01.100
incomplete,

30:01.760 --> 30:02.580
which leads to this

30:02.580 --> 30:03.700
strict inclusion hierarchy.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.000
Yes, this hierarchy shows

30:05.000 --> 30:06.160
the progression of complexity

30:06.160 --> 30:06.880
and constraint.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.580
GD is a subset of SGDM,

30:09.880 --> 30:10.560
which is a subset

30:10.560 --> 30:11.520
of remaining in momentum,

30:11.780 --> 30:12.980
which is a subset of MAI-GI.

30:12.980 --> 30:13.940
Starting at the bottom,

30:14.080 --> 30:14.820
the move from standard

30:14.820 --> 30:16.140
gradient descent to SGDM

30:16.140 --> 30:17.060
just adds momentum.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.940
Right, but SGDM is the first

30:18.940 --> 30:19.860
to suffer severe

30:19.860 --> 30:20.980
off-manifold drift

30:20.980 --> 30:22.380
because it blindly accepts

30:22.380 --> 30:23.220
the accumulation

30:23.220 --> 30:24.240
of geometric error.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.300
Then the next jump

30:25.300 --> 30:26.140
from SGDM

30:26.140 --> 30:26.760
to the standard

30:26.760 --> 30:27.600
Romanian momentum

30:27.600 --> 30:28.460
is purely about

30:28.460 --> 30:29.780
adding intrinsic geometry,

30:29.940 --> 30:30.780
acknowledging curvature,

30:31.020 --> 30:31.940
and using geodesics.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.140
So Romanian momentum

30:33.140 --> 30:34.460
is better than SGDM

30:34.460 --> 30:35.040
because it accounts

30:35.040 --> 30:35.500
for curvature,

30:35.800 --> 30:36.860
but it still fails

30:36.860 --> 30:37.440
because it lacks

30:37.440 --> 30:38.100
the constraint.

30:38.340 --> 30:38.740
Exactly.

30:39.140 --> 30:39.980
It still permits

30:39.980 --> 30:41.040
normal components

30:41.040 --> 30:42.200
of the ambient gradient

30:42.200 --> 30:43.400
to accumulate

30:43.400 --> 30:44.520
in the velocity term.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.800
It solves the geodesic problem,

30:47.080 --> 30:48.500
but not the off-manifold

30:48.500 --> 30:49.540
stability problem.

30:49.780 --> 30:50.320
And finally,

30:50.560 --> 30:51.840
the move from Romanian momentum

30:51.840 --> 30:52.660
to MAI-GI

30:52.660 --> 30:54.520
completes the structural defense.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.880
MGI adds the stratification

30:56.880 --> 30:58.180
to handle singularities,

30:58.680 --> 30:59.980
the structured potentials,

31:00.240 --> 31:01.380
and most crucially,

31:02.000 --> 31:03.560
the tangent projection operator

31:03.560 --> 31:05.300
for normal component suppression.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.000
This makes MGI

31:07.000 --> 31:07.960
the only framework

31:07.960 --> 31:08.760
in this hierarchy

31:08.760 --> 31:09.960
that is structurally capable

31:09.960 --> 31:11.120
of maintaining stability

31:11.120 --> 31:12.780
and semantic coherence.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.440
The conclusion is powerful.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.000
SGDM works because

31:16.000 --> 31:17.440
in many low-curvature regions,

31:17.580 --> 31:18.440
the ambient space

31:18.440 --> 31:20.000
is a good local approximation

31:20.000 --> 31:21.100
of the true manifold,

31:21.460 --> 31:22.960
but it fails exactly

31:22.960 --> 31:24.660
when the underlying geometric structure,

31:24.920 --> 31:25.320
the curvature,

31:25.580 --> 31:26.500
or the singularities,

31:26.620 --> 31:27.280
asserts itself.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.660
We've taken this long journey

31:28.660 --> 31:29.380
through geometry

31:29.380 --> 31:30.240
and proven

31:30.240 --> 31:31.440
the fundamental relationship.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.200
Now let's conclude

31:33.200 --> 31:34.760
by tying the technical geometry

31:34.760 --> 31:36.000
back to the practical meaning

31:36.000 --> 31:37.260
and the aha moments

31:37.260 --> 31:39.000
for you listening

31:39.000 --> 31:40.040
if you're interested

31:40.040 --> 31:40.820
in robust,

31:41.020 --> 31:42.520
interpretable AI systems.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.960
The overarching semantic implication

31:44.960 --> 31:46.140
rests entirely

31:46.140 --> 31:47.540
on that geometric decomposition.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.480
The core dichotomy

31:49.480 --> 31:51.300
of tangent versus normal directions

31:51.300 --> 31:53.620
is a direct, actionable analogy

31:53.620 --> 31:55.320
for semantic coherence

31:55.320 --> 31:56.380
versus incoherence.

31:56.420 --> 31:56.620
Right.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.140
Tangent directions represent

31:58.140 --> 31:59.820
permissible semantic variation.

32:00.340 --> 32:01.620
You can change the parameter vector,

32:02.000 --> 32:03.240
but the output still makes sense.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.500
Normal directions

32:04.500 --> 32:06.460
are incoherent perturbations movement

32:06.460 --> 32:08.120
that immediately destroys meaning.

32:08.640 --> 32:09.760
And Medgei's strength

32:09.760 --> 32:11.280
is that it imposes coherence

32:11.280 --> 32:12.460
by just discarding

32:12.460 --> 32:13.420
that orthogonal motion

32:13.420 --> 32:14.400
at every single step.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.020
At every step.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.420
This link between geometry

32:16.420 --> 32:17.020
and meaning

32:17.020 --> 32:18.860
means that the optimization process

32:18.860 --> 32:20.360
itself becomes interpretable.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.140
Absolutely.

32:21.860 --> 32:22.540
Interpretability

32:22.540 --> 32:24.100
through geometry is key.

32:24.540 --> 32:26.240
The strata are semantic modes

32:26.240 --> 32:27.200
or, you know,

32:27.300 --> 32:28.360
representational templates.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.220
If you are training

32:30.220 --> 32:31.380
a model on sentences,

32:31.380 --> 32:33.000
one stratum might be

32:33.000 --> 32:33.480
the manifold

32:33.480 --> 32:34.960
of all grammatically correct

32:34.960 --> 32:35.900
declarative sentences

32:35.900 --> 32:37.160
and another might be

32:37.160 --> 32:38.960
all grammatically correct questions.

32:39.220 --> 32:40.140
And the system's behavior

32:40.140 --> 32:41.520
near the strata boundaries

32:41.520 --> 32:43.600
reveals its structural limits.

32:44.000 --> 32:44.320
Ah, yes.

32:44.900 --> 32:45.640
Stratum transitions

32:45.640 --> 32:46.940
are semantic shifts,

32:47.520 --> 32:48.020
discrete,

32:48.320 --> 32:49.080
high-level changes

32:49.080 --> 32:49.800
in interpretation.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.340
And because the system

32:51.340 --> 32:51.980
is operating

32:51.980 --> 32:53.640
on a stratified Morse potential,

32:54.300 --> 32:54.720
these shits

32:54.720 --> 32:55.800
are not random accidents.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.320
They are geometrically

32:57.320 --> 32:59.340
meaningful topological events.

32:59.340 --> 33:00.480
They always lead

33:00.480 --> 33:01.980
to a lower potential energy

33:01.980 --> 33:03.180
and move to a better-suited

33:03.180 --> 33:03.920
semantic mode.

33:04.140 --> 33:04.740
Let's just reiterate

33:04.740 --> 33:06.340
the immense practical implication

33:06.960 --> 33:08.540
for stability and robustness

33:08.540 --> 33:09.760
given how much time

33:09.760 --> 33:10.600
engineers spend

33:10.600 --> 33:11.460
trying to tame

33:11.460 --> 33:13.040
SGDM's instability.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.980
Look, SGDM attempts

33:14.980 --> 33:15.740
to counteract

33:15.740 --> 33:16.540
extrinsic drift

33:16.540 --> 33:17.620
via numerical tuning

33:17.620 --> 33:18.680
fiddling with learning rates,

33:19.000 --> 33:19.700
clipping gradients.

33:20.280 --> 33:21.200
AtmatGI provides

33:21.200 --> 33:22.100
a structural solution.

33:22.740 --> 33:23.400
It is structurally

33:23.400 --> 33:24.680
incapable of accumulating

33:24.680 --> 33:25.400
extrinsic drift

33:25.400 --> 33:26.500
because the tangent

33:26.500 --> 33:27.540
projection mechanism

33:27.540 --> 33:28.400
suppresses it

33:28.400 --> 33:29.260
at every single step.

33:29.260 --> 33:30.120
It's inherently stable.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.520
It's inherently stable.

33:31.900 --> 33:32.720
And the use of

33:32.720 --> 33:34.340
stratified Morse potentials

33:34.340 --> 33:35.700
avoids the pathological

33:35.700 --> 33:36.540
critical sets

33:36.540 --> 33:37.980
like degenerate saddles

33:37.980 --> 33:39.080
that are so prevalent

33:39.080 --> 33:40.460
in arbitrary loss functions.

33:41.180 --> 33:42.200
This means better convergence

33:42.200 --> 33:43.460
and better generalization.

33:43.860 --> 33:45.120
So if SGDM

33:45.120 --> 33:46.060
is about optimizing

33:46.060 --> 33:47.100
the function value,

33:47.600 --> 33:49.260
MEGI is about optimizing

33:49.260 --> 33:50.560
the geometric relationship

33:50.560 --> 33:51.600
between the parameters

33:51.600 --> 33:52.740
and the data manifold.

33:53.060 --> 33:53.700
Precisely.

33:54.220 --> 33:55.160
MBEI aligns

33:55.160 --> 33:56.780
the entire optimization process

33:56.780 --> 33:58.160
with the intrinsic topology,

33:58.160 --> 33:58.860
curvature,

33:58.860 --> 33:59.980
and stratification

33:59.980 --> 34:01.000
of the semantic domain.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.820
It moves momentum methods

34:02.820 --> 34:04.360
from geometry-blind navigation

34:04.360 --> 34:05.180
in flat space

34:05.180 --> 34:06.940
to structurally guided motion

34:06.940 --> 34:08.060
in a geometrically rich,

34:08.180 --> 34:08.920
meaningful space.

34:09.300 --> 34:10.940
It completes the conceptual arc

34:10.940 --> 34:11.940
of heavy ball dynamics.

34:12.080 --> 34:12.620
This has been

34:12.620 --> 34:13.900
an incredibly rigorous

34:13.900 --> 34:14.520
deep dive.

34:14.900 --> 34:15.420
We learned that

34:15.420 --> 34:16.500
the ubiquitous workhorse

34:16.500 --> 34:17.320
of modern AI,

34:17.460 --> 34:17.920
SGDM,

34:17.980 --> 34:19.300
is not a fundamental dynamic,

34:19.560 --> 34:20.720
but rather the structurally

34:20.720 --> 34:22.520
minimal and geometry-free limit

34:22.520 --> 34:23.540
of a far broader

34:23.540 --> 34:24.600
and more robust theory,

34:25.100 --> 34:26.140
the MGI framework.

34:26.140 --> 34:27.420
And the key takeaway

34:27.420 --> 34:28.780
is that structural difference.

34:29.620 --> 34:30.620
SGDM achieves

34:30.620 --> 34:32.000
computational simplicity

34:32.000 --> 34:34.080
by explicitly ignoring

34:34.080 --> 34:35.160
the geometric constraint

34:35.160 --> 34:36.100
of tangent projection,

34:36.560 --> 34:37.320
which is the source

34:37.320 --> 34:38.540
of its drift and oscillation.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.420
NGI embraces

34:40.420 --> 34:41.620
the geometric complexity

34:41.620 --> 34:43.260
and forcing that constraint

34:43.260 --> 34:44.660
to provide unparalleled

34:44.660 --> 34:46.360
stability and interpretability.

34:46.720 --> 34:47.340
So geometry,

34:47.980 --> 34:49.340
when properly introduced.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.060
Geometry is the ultimate

34:51.060 --> 34:52.040
structural defense

34:52.040 --> 34:53.100
against incoherence

34:53.100 --> 34:53.520
in learning.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.600
Which leaves us

34:54.600 --> 34:55.700
with a provocative thought

34:55.700 --> 34:56.660
for you, the learner.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.560
If SGDM is revealed

34:58.560 --> 34:59.660
to be the degenerate

34:59.660 --> 35:01.200
geometric limit of NGI,

35:01.760 --> 35:02.440
this suggests

35:02.440 --> 35:03.740
a universal principle.

35:04.240 --> 35:04.960
Whenever we observe

35:04.960 --> 35:06.840
complex, seemingly fragile

35:06.840 --> 35:07.640
learning behavior

35:07.640 --> 35:08.700
in common algorithms,

35:08.860 --> 35:09.460
be it momentum

35:09.460 --> 35:10.860
or perhaps adaptive learning

35:10.860 --> 35:11.900
rate methods like Atom,

35:12.400 --> 35:13.260
it's likely a sign

35:13.260 --> 35:14.440
that the underlying dynamics

35:14.440 --> 35:15.060
are struggling

35:15.060 --> 35:16.120
because they are respecting

35:16.120 --> 35:18.260
a hidden, non-Euclidean geometry

35:18.260 --> 35:19.340
without having the tools

35:19.340 --> 35:20.120
to navigate it.

35:20.180 --> 35:20.880
So the question is,

35:20.880 --> 35:22.740
what other common learning algorithms

35:22.740 --> 35:23.780
might also be revealed

35:23.780 --> 35:24.860
as degenerate limits

35:24.860 --> 35:25.600
of a more general

35:25.600 --> 35:26.580
geometric structure

35:26.580 --> 35:28.260
and how much performance

35:28.260 --> 35:28.840
and stability

35:28.840 --> 35:29.460
could be gained

35:29.460 --> 35:31.020
if we simply reinstated

35:31.020 --> 35:32.980
their suppressed geometric structure?

35:33.340 --> 35:34.320
We encourage you

35:34.320 --> 35:35.760
to explore the fascinating world

35:35.760 --> 35:36.860
of Whitney stratification

35:36.860 --> 35:38.180
and Remanian optimization.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.700
Until the next deep dive,

35:39.860 --> 35:40.360
keep learning.
